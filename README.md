# Omarchy Theme Development

Start here if you're creating or iterating on a desktop theme for the Omarchy system.

## Where to Begin

 Read `CONTEXT.md` first to understand the nature of the task and update it as you desire. 

 Then, follow the instructions below.

### IF USING A TERMINAL EDITOR
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Navigate up a level, and invoke your Terminal-based AI assistant (e.g., Claude Code, etc.)
3. Instruct to review the CONTEXT.md file for its task, and provide instructions on the theme that you want to generate.

### IF USING A CHAT GUI
1. Provide the repo's files in a new Project, with the Project instructions to begin by reading CONTEXT.md. 
2. When starting a new chat, give it the instructions for a new theme.


## Recommended Theme Descriptions

1. Define intent: the gist of the theme, dark/light, mood, contrast requirements, and any wallpaper inspiration. 
2. (Optional) Provide guidance on palette colors using a harmony (complementary, triadic, analogous, or monochrome). See color-theory.md for additional color theory context. You can provide any amount of information here to guide it.

## Next Steps

- After palette selection, implement following `creating-themes.md` and validate against the checklist.
- Keep edits focused on colors; avoid changing unrelated settings.
